### 🐱 Hi, I'm Junta

I’m a 2nd-year Computer Science student at HCMUS – University of Science (VNU-HCM).  
I enjoy learning new technologies, staying open-minded, and tackling challenging problems in creative ways.

I’m currently focusing on **Backend Development** and **DevOps**.  
Most of my daily work involves **C++** and **JavaScript**, and I’m also familiar with **Python** and **Go**.

Some projects I’ve worked on:
- An enhanced **Wordle-style game** with improved mechanics and UX  
- A **social, trip-planning web app** for people who love traveling  
- A **web app for interview preparation and CV support**

During high school, I received several programming-related awards and participated in **ICPC**, reaching the **National round**.  
In the next year, my main goal is to earn an **internship as a Backend or DevOps engineer** and continue building real-world systems.
